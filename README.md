# euler
I'm keeping this here as proof that I solved the project Euler problems.

Listen, if you want to use my solutions here to solve the problems, you're depriving yourself of all the advantages that you would otherwise gain by trying to solve them yourself.
This is mostly for convenience, I can talk this up all I want, but seeing solutions is a lot more convincing than trusting that I have done them.
So when i can afford to make this a private repo I will, but until then, don't peek unless you want to ruin the fun of Euler for yourself.
